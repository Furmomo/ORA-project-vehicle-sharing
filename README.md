## Background and Problem Statement
In our project, we aim to establish an scheduling system for an autonomous vehicle sharing company. 
The system will receive orders from customers. And in each order, we will receive information regarding the pickup location, delivery location, pickup time and delivery time.
Based on these information, our system will optimally determine the number of autonomous vehicles we should dispatched and the trip chain for each autonomous vehicles.

In our system, each AV is dispatched from depot at the begin of a day and return to depot at the end of the day for maintenance and preparation for the next day
